            ### What is RAG?
            
            **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** is a powerful AI technique that enhances large language models (LLMs) by combining them with external knowledge retrieval systems.
            
            ### Why RAG?
            
            LLMs are trained on static datasets and can't access real-time or domain-specific information. RAG solves this by:
            - âœ… Providing up-to-date information
            - âœ… Reducing hallucinations
            - âœ… Adding domain-specific knowledge
            - âœ… Improving answer accuracy
            
            ### The Three Pipeline Stages:
            
            **ðŸ”Ž 1. Retrieval**
            - Documents are split into chunks
            - Chunks are converted to vector embeddings
            - User query is embedded and similar chunks are retrieved
            
            **ðŸ”— 2. Augmentation**
            - Retrieved chunks are combined with the user's query
            - Context is formatted into a prompt for the LLM
            
            **âœ¨ 3. Generation**
            - LLM generates a response using the retrieved context
            - Answer is grounded in actual documents, not just model knowledge
