### 1. Zip2 Corporation (1995–1999)
Musk’s first company, Zip2, provided online business directories and maps for newspapers. It was sold to Compaq for nearly $300 million, marking his first major success as an entrepreneur.

### 2. X.com and PayPal (1999–2002)
Musk founded X.com, an online payment company, which later became PayPal after a merger. Under Musk’s leadership, PayPal became a pioneer in digital payments and was eventually acquired by eBay for $1.5 billion in stock.

### 3. SpaceX (2002–Present)
Founded with the goal of reducing space transportation costs and enabling the colonization of Mars, **SpaceX (Space Exploration Technologies Corp.)** has achieved remarkable milestones:
- First privately funded company to send a spacecraft to orbit and return it safely.  
- First private company to dock a spacecraft with the International Space Station.  
- Development of reusable rockets like Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy.  
- Creation of *Starship*, intended for interplanetary travel.  
- Launch of *Starlink*, a global satellite internet network.

SpaceX has redefined space exploration economics and made reusability a central concept in rocket design.

### 4. Tesla, Inc. (2004–Present)
Musk joined Tesla Motors (now Tesla, Inc.) as an early investor and became CEO in 2008. Under his leadership, Tesla became the world’s leading electric vehicle manufacturer, producing models such as the Model S, Model 3, Model X, and Model Y.

Key innovations include:
- Development of long-range lithium-ion battery systems.  
- Creation of Supercharger networks.  
- Autopilot and Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology.  
- Expansion into energy storage and solar power through Tesla Energy.

Tesla’s success helped make electric vehicles mainstream and reshaped the global auto industry.

### 5. SolarCity (2006–2016)
Founded by Musk’s cousins and backed by him, SolarCity became one of the largest providers of solar energy systems in the U.S. before being acquired by Tesla in 2016, integrating clean energy generation and storage under one company.

### 6. Neuralink (2016–Present)
Neuralink focuses on developing brain–computer interface (BCI) technology that could help treat neurological conditions and eventually enhance human cognition. Musk envisions a future where humans can merge symbiotically with artificial intelligence.

### 7. The Boring Company (2016–Present)
Created to solve urban traffic congestion, The Boring Company develops tunneling technologies for high-speed underground transport. Its projects include the *Las Vegas Loop* and conceptual designs for *hyperloop* transportation systems.

### 8. Twitter/X (2022–Present)
In 2022, Musk acquired Twitter for $44 billion, citing the goal of promoting free speech and product innovation. He later rebranded the platform as **X**, aiming to transform it into an “everything app” combining social media, payments, and AI-driven services.
